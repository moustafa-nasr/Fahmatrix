# Fahmatrix

**Fahmatrix** is a lightweight, modern Java library for working with tabular data, inspired by Python's Pandas and rooted in the idea of making data understanding (*fahm*) easy on the JVM.

🚀 Intuitive API for tabular data  
📄 Easy CSV reading and previewing  
🔍 Row filtering and column selection  
📊 Aggregations, grouping, and sorting (coming soon)  
🧩 No external dependencies (for now)

## 💡 Why Fahmatrix?

Java has lacked a clean, expressive DataFrame API — until now.

Fahmatrix brings data clarity (*fahm*) and structured thinking (*matrix*) together to give Java developers the tools they need to work with tabular data effectively, without leaving the JVM.
